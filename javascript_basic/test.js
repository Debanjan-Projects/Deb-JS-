//difference between .txt and .js file 

//A .txt file is a plain text file used to store simple, unformatted information such as notes, data, or documentation. It cannot be executed by a computer and is mainly opened using text editors like Notepad or TextEdit. In contrast, a .js file is a JavaScript file that contains executable code used to add interactivity, logic, and functionality to web pages. JavaScript files are run by web browsers or environments like Node.js. While a .txt file only holds readable text, a .js file holds code that can perform tasks, manipulate web content, and enhance user experience on websites.

// ✅ Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009.
// He developed it using Google’s V8 JavaScript engine to allow developers to run JavaScript code outside the browser, mainly for building fast and scalable server-side applications.

// ✅ Deno.js was also created by Ryan Dahl in 2018.
// It was built as a modern, secure replacement for Node.js — addressing some of Node’s design issues, like security and module management, and supports TypeScript by default.
