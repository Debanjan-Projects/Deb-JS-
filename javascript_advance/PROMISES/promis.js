//what is promises?
//The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

//jho apne ushko task diya hain ohh abhi ke abhi queue mein lagke task complete nahi hoga .queue mein to abhi load ho chuka hain lekin abhi ke abhi complete nahi hoga ..

//kernel... then fetch the file ..


//A Promise is in one of these states:

// pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.

// fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.

// rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
